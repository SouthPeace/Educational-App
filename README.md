Educational App - Mobile Application

Description:

Developed a comprehensive educational mobile application designed to guide users through various stages of learning and task management. 
The app is content-configurable through a robust content management system (CMS), allowing administrators to easily update and manage the app's content.

Key Features:

-Sliding Carousel: The app features a sliding carousel on the main page, offering users different options related to specific content areas (e.g., chicken farming stages like starter, middle, and finisher). Selecting an option takes users to a detailed page filled with relevant information.
-Task Program Generation: After selecting a content option, the app generates a program of daily tasks spread over a set period. These tasks guide users through the content stage, providing a structured learning experience.
-Weekly Calendar: Below the carousel, users can access a weekly calendar that displays daily tasks. The calendar allows users to edit tasks for the current day and view tasks for other days. A sync button ensures that all tasks are updated in the database as they are completed.
-Business Portfolio Section: This section provides insights into various business-related topics, helping users gain deeper knowledge on specific areas of interest.
Quiz Page: The app includes a quiz section with quizzes on various topics to ensure users are retaining the information and understanding the content thoroughly.
-Content Management System (CMS): The app's content is fully configurable via the CMS, allowing administrators to add, remove, and edit content and media such as images. This flexibility makes it easy to keep the app's content up to date and relevant.

Note: Images in media file and CMS webapp images in dashboard folder inside MEDIA folder

Technologies & Packages:

-Data Management: Utilized http for REST API calls and shared_preferences for storing user preferences locally.
-User Interface: Employed intl for internationalization, rounded_expansion_tile for expandable UI elements, and provider for state management.
-Notifications & Permissions: Integrated fluttertoast for user notifications, and permission_handler for managing app permissions.
-File Handling: Used file_picker for selecting files, syncfusion_flutter_pdf and syncfusion_flutter_pdfviewer for PDF handling, and path_provider for accessing device directories.
-Device Information: Incorporated device_info_plus for gathering device-specific data, enhancing user experience and troubleshooting.

Note: The app's design ensures that content is easily accessible and engaging, making it a valuable tool for users to learn and manage tasks efficiently.
